Image recognition has been a major challenge in machine learning, and working with large labelled datasets to train your algorithms can be time-consuming. One efficient approach for getting such data is to outsource the work to a large crowd of users. Google uses this approach with the game “Quick, Draw!” to create the world’s largest doodling dataset, which has recently been made publicly available. In this game, you are told what to draw in less than 20 seconds while a neural network is predicting in real time what the drawing represents. Once the prediction is correct, you can't finish your drawing, which results in some drawings looking rather weird (e.g., animals missing limbs). The dataset consists of 50 million drawings spanning 345 categories, including animals, vehicles, instruments and other items. By contrast, the MNIST dataset – also known as the “Hello World” of machine learning – includes no more than 70,000 handwritten digits. Compared with digits, the variability within each category of the “Quick, Draw!” data is much bigger, as there are many more ways to draw a cat than to write the number 8, say.
